  <p>Brendan Greene always liked modding games, and he created the Arma2
  mod DayZ: Battle Royale.</p>
    <p>When DayZ became its own standalone title, his interest in his ArmA 2 version
 of the Battle Royale mod trailed off, and Greene transitioned development of the mod to ArmA 3.
  Sony Online Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had become interested in Greene's work,
   and brought him on as a consultant to develop on H1Z1, licensing the Battle Royale idea from him.
    In February 2016, Sony Online split H1Z1 into two seperate games, the survival mode H1Z1: Just Survive,
    and the battle royale-like H1Z1: King of the Hill, around the same time that Greene's consultation period was over.</p>

    <h3 class="post-title">Starting a new video game Genre</h3>
    <div class="post-content"
    <p>The <strong>battle Royale</strong> genre was inspired by the Japanese movie "Battle Royale"
      that was aired in 2000. Since then,Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, a video game modder that made
      a few Battle Royale mods for some video games, decided to create his own BR game,
      so he partnered with the company Bluehole and they started working on the record braking game
      <em>"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"</em>.</p>
      <p>After the insane rise of PUBG, Epic Games decided to combine the Battle Royale genre
        into their not-so-popular game Fortnite. The twist with fortnite was that it was a free to play game, unlike
        PUBG, that currently costs 30$. Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and is currently the most popular game,
        while making Epic Games around 300$ million a month through micro-transactions.</p>
